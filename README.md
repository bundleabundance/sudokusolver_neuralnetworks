# sudokusolver_neuralnetworks

Welcome to the Sudoku Solver project! This project aims to solve Sudoku puzzles using an efficient algorithm and provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for an interactive experience. Additionally, the project is a work in progress, with ongoing development focused on implementing a neural network model to recognize Sudoku grids from pictures.

Features
Sudoku Solver Algorithm: Solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm that efficiently finds solutions for given Sudoku boards.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Interact with the Sudoku solver through a user-friendly GUI. Input Sudoku puzzles, solve them, and visualize the solutions.
Neural Network Model (Work in Progress): The project includes ongoing work on implementing a neural network model for recognizing Sudoku grids from images. This feature is currently under development and not yet functional.

Usage
Clone the Repository:
`
git clone https://github.com/bundleabundance/sudokusolver_neuralnetworks.git`
Navigate to the Project Directory:
`
cd sudokusolver_neuralnetworks
`
Run the Sudoku Solver GUI:
`
python sudokusolver_neuralnetworks.py`
This command will launch the GUI application, allowing you to input Sudoku puzzles and solve them interactively.

Neural Network Model (Work in Progress)
The neural network model for recognizing Sudoku grids from images is currently under development. If you have expertise in machine learning and computer vision, your contributions to this part of the project are highly encouraged. Feel free to explore the neural_network directory and contribute to the development efforts.
